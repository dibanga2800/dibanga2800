Hi, I'm David Ibanga — Data Engineer | Cloud Data Specialist ☁️👨🏾‍💻  
Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a UK-based Data Engineer with 3+ years of hands-on experience designing, building, and optimizing data pipelines and cloud-based data platforms. I help organizations transform raw data into reliable, high-quality assets that fuel analytics, reporting, and machine learning.

My approach combines engineering discipline with a problem-solving mindset — using tools like Apache Spark, Airflow, and Kafka to build scalable systems that handle complex data challenges efficiently.

## What I Do Best 🛠️

📊 **Data Pipeline Engineering**  
Design and implementation of batch and streaming ETL pipelines using Apache Spark, Kafka, and Airflow — enabling scalable, fault-tolerant data flows across systems.

🏗️ **Cloud Data Architecture**  
Architect cost-effective and performance-optimized data platforms in GCP, AWS, and Azure. I’ve delivered data warehouse solutions that reduce cost by up to 50% while increasing reliability.

🗄️ **Database Optimization**  
Experienced with PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MySQL, and MongoDB. I tune schemas, build indexes, and write performant SQL to power real-time dashboards and BI reports.

📈 **Data Analytics Enablement**  
I collaborate with analytics and data science teams to ensure clean, reliable datasets — transforming messy inputs into strategic insights using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

🔒 **Data Governance & CI/CD**  
Implement automated quality checks and CI/CD workflows via Azure DevOps and Git, ensuring data trust, traceability, and fast iteration across development teams.
